**Subject**: **_Update on Tasks 1 and 2 - Family Emergency_**

Dear Manoj and Ravi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to update you on the status of Tasks 1 and 2 and to inform you of my approach in light of a recent family emergency.

As you are aware, I will not be able to meet the original due date for both tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for Customer A, a low-priority customer who has not provided a go-live date, and Task 2 is for Customer B, a priority customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days.

Given the situation, I have prioritized Task 2 and will be reaching out to Customer B to request an extension and explain the situation with the family emergency. I will do my best to minimize the impact on the customer's campaign and maintain a positive relationship with Customer B.

For Task 1, I will be able to complete it within the original due date or shortly thereafter, once I have addressed the priority task. I understand that Customer A is a low-priority customer, and I will make sure to keep you updated on the progress.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will be happy to provide further information.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Akash
