**Subject: _Request for Extension Due to Family Emergency_**

Dear Customer,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a recent family emergency that has arisen, and its impact on the completion of your Task.

As you are aware, your Task is for your campaign, which was scheduled to go live in the next 2 days. Unfortunately, due to the family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original due date for this task for at least 3 more days.

I would like to express my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I am doing everything in my power to minimize the impact on your campaign. I have prioritized your Task and am taking steps to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible.

In light of the situation, I am reaching out to request an extension for the Task. I understand that this may cause some disruption to your plans, and I would like to offer my assistance in finding alternative solutions if needed.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will be happy to provide further information. I will keep you updated on the progress and ensure that you are satisfied with the solution.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Akash Kumar
