### What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this ?

**_My approach to solving this issue would be as follows:_**

- Prioritize tasks: I would prioritize Task 2 as it is for a priority customer and needs to go live in the next 2 days, whereas Task 1 is for a low-priority customer and has not provided a go-live date.

- Communication: I would reach out to the customer for Task 2 and explain the situation with the family emergency and the impact it has on meeting the original due date. I would request for an extension and explain the situation as clearly and professionally as possible.

- Offering solutions: If the customer is unable to grant an extension, I would offer alternative solutions, such as reassigning the task to another team member, working overtime or on weekends, or using technology to accelerate the process.

- Time management: I would prioritize and manage my time effectively to complete Task 2 within the extended deadline and minimize the impact on the customer's campaign.

- Follow-up: I would follow up with the customer regularly to keep them updated on the progress and ensure that they are satisfied with the solution.
